"""
This script updates the weights used in splitting to include weights for "Old
Andhra Pradesh" It does this by just copying the weights for "Andhra Pradesh",
resetting the location_id to be that of "Old Andhra Pradesh", and appending
that to the weights.

This operation should be performed every time that there are new weights as long
as there is a need to split Old Andhra Pradesh.  This script should be resistent
to GBD round changes and changes to the location heirarchy identified by 
location_set_id = 82.  However, filepaths for the input and output weights will
need to be updated.
