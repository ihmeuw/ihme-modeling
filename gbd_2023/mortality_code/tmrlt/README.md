# Theoretical Minimum Risk Life Table (TMRLT)

> Compile the lowest observed age-specific mortality into a life table
representing the theoretically ideal health state of a population.

## Inputs

- With-shock canonical life tables (life tables with detailed under 1 and
  single year ages)
- Total population estimates


## Calculation

The TMRLT is generated by taking the results of the with-shock canonical life
tables, and finding the lowest _qx_ values (or highest _ax_ value for the
terminal age group) within each age group. Only national locations with
a population greater than 5 million people in the most recent included year of
estimation are considered. Additionally, estimates prior to 2010 are excluded
with the reasoning that all-cause mortality has reached its lowest point in
history in more recent years*. With these selected location-age-sex-years,
life table parameters are recalculated using the _mx_, _ax_, and _qx_ values
to create a life table representing the theoretically lowest age-specific
mortality a cohort could currently achieve.

\* _For GBD 2021, years 2020-2022 were excluded from consideration for the
TMRLT due to the COVID-19 pandemic._


## Precise Age Life Expectancy

From the TMRLT a table of precise life expectancy estimates are calculated
though a linear interpolation of life expectancy to one-hundredth-of-year
age steps. These values are later used to calculate Pred-_ex_.
