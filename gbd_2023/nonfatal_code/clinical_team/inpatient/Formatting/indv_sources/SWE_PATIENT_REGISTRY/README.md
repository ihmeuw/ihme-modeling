## SWE_PATIENT_REGISTRY data formatting

This source should no longer be considered "old source" in the context of inpatient data processing (starting from run_41) so we are going to consolidate the 98-12 (.dta) and 15-16 (.H5, and possibly more years to come) data moving forwards.

The two formatting scripts have not been updated yet and ideally in the future we should have only one python script that formats all years of SWE data.
