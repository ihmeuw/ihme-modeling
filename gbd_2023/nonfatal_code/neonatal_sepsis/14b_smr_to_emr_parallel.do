******************************
** Purpose: Create cause and location-specific excess mortality data for DisMod to use to calculate long-term outcomes. 
** The EMR data is created by pulling in the location-specific all-cause mortality rate (mx) and calculating emr = mx * (smr - 1)
** 05_smr_to_emr.do submits this script in parallel for every location
