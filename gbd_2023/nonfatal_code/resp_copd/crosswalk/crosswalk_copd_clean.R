#The intention for this function is to create a dataframe that is the collapsed and merged data that will be used in crosswalks.
# It subsets out the reference data in a bundle and the non-reference data. It cuts these data depending on where the user wants
# them by age and year. The function returns a dataframe that is prepped for calculating the mean effect for the ratio in a crosswalk
# that can be used either in rma() or in MR-BRT.
# Written by USERNAME, DATE - modified by USERNAME
#
# 1. df is the dataframe (i.e. bundle data)
# 2. covariate_name is the name of the binary column for the crosswalk (i.e. cv_)
# 3. merge_type is how you want the data to be merged by study. The options are
#         "within" means an exact match within a single study (merges by NID, age_start, age_end, year_start, year_end, sex)
#         "between" means a close match by location, year, and age 
#          "market" means marketscan comparison so no matching by year
# 4. location_match is at what level do you want your data merged by location, meaning how close geographically is a match?
#         "exact" merges by location_id; "country" collapses subnationals into single value
#         "region" collapses regional data to single value; "super" collapses super regional data to single value
# 5. year_range is the number of years above or below year_start and year_end of the reference study that will be used for a comparison
