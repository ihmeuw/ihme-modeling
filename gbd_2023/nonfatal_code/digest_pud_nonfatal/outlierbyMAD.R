### Description: Accepts data as data.table argument, identifies data-series (defined by sex, location, year and NID) for which all observed values are 0 and those for which the age-adjusted mean is more than xMADs above or below median, marks them as outliers, returns data.table that can be uploaded to Epi DB.  Should be applied to data that have already had sex and age patterns imposed and have been cross-walked toward reference study design, if any of those transformations are required.

# To source this function from another script: source("/FILEPATH/code/outlierbyMAD.R")

# Requires the following packages

# Also requires
## data that are in a standard set of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive age-groups
## an age_dt table of global population age-weights for the set of mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive age-groups in the data
