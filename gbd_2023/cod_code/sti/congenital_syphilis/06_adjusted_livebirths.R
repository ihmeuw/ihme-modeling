# Purpose: Need to take increased risk of APO for syphilitic women into account: 
#          1) Take the unadjusted live births (by location and early/late), split them into livebirths by visit proportion 
#          2) and then apply treatment definitions to split by treatment status.
#          3) Apply: live births * (1 - early/late death rate) to get the adjusted live births for each treatment group
#               Adequately treated is untouched
