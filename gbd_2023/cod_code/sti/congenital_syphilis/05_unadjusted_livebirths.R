#' @purpose: By multiplying the age-specific fertility rate by the population (females of child-bearing age),
#'           we can calculate the total number of livebirths for a location-year. Multiplying this by the 
#'           seroprevalence of syphilis (from the early syphilis dismod model) gives the number of live births
#'           at risk for syphilis, unadjusted by the increased risk of fetal loss in those with syphilis 
#'           infections.

# Calculate live births from uninfected women ----------------------------------------------
# Calculate the number of livebirths at risk of congenital syphilis. Historically, this was simply
#          a multiplication of age-specific fertility rate and population (by age/year/location ofc),
#          but that doesn't take into account the increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO)
#          seen in syphilitic women, namely an increase in miscarriages and fetal loss that would lower
#          the actual number of livebirths. So later we work in the proportion of women with early/late syphilis
#          and the differential fetal loss rates.
