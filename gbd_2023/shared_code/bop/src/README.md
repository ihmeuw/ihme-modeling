* `fit_signal_model`: fit signal model, this action will automatically call
`plot_signal_model` as well for creating the diagonstic figure.
* `select_bias_covs`: select the bias covariates
* `fit_linear_model`: fit linear model, this action will autmatically call
`complete_summary` and `plot_linear_model` to create summary yaml file and
