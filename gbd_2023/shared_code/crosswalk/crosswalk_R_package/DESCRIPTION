Title: Adjusting non-standard observations using (network) meta-regression

Description: In meta-analysis and other forms of data synthesis, the quantity of interest might be measured in different ways. 
    For example, estimates of a population's obesity prevalence could be based on self-reported height/weight or anthropomorphic measurements. 
    Crosswalking is the process of estimating what a non-standard (e.g. self-reported) observation would be had it been measured with the gold standard method. 
    This package is an implementation of crosswalking methods used in the Global Burden of Disease Study at IHME.
