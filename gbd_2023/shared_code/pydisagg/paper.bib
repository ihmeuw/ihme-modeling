abstract = {Linear mixed-effects models are a class of models widely used for analyzing different types of data: longitudinal, clustered and panel data. Many fields, in which a statistical methodology is required, involve the employment of linear mixed models, such as biology, chemistry, medicine, finance and so forth. One of the most important processes, in a statistical analysis, is given by model_name selection. Hence, since there are a large number of linear mixed model_name selection procedures available in the literature, a pressing issue is how to identify the best approach to adopt in a specific case. We outline mainly all approaches focusing on the part of the model_name subject to selection (fixed and/or random), the dimensionality of models and the structure of variance and covariance matrices, and also, wherever possible, the existence of an implemented application of the methodologies set out.},

@article{Mendible2020,
abstract = {We develop an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for the automated discovery and identification of traveling waves in spatiotemporal systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Our method uses sparse regression and subspace clustering to robustly identify translational invariances that can be leveraged to build improved reduced-order models (ROMs). Invariances, whether translational or rotational, are well known to compromise the ability of ROMs to produce accurate and/or low-rank representations of the spatiotemporal dynamics. However, by discovering translations in a principled way, data can be shifted into a coordinate systems where quality, low-dimensional ROMs can be constructed. This approach can be used on either numerical or experimental data with or without knowledge of the governing equations. We demonstrate our method on a variety of PDEs of increasing difficulty, taken from the field of fluid dynamics, showing the efficacy and robustness of the proposed approach.},
