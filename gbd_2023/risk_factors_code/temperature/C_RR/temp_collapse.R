# Summary: This function loops over all year of VR data, imports the corresponding temperature data, merges the two,
# and then collapses the result to produce a dataset of cause-specific death counts and population totals (person-days)
# by location, date, age, sex, and temperature category
#
# Requires: data.table (should have already been loaded by the master script)
