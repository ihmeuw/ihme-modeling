# Summary: This function takes a cleaned and formatted VR dataset and...
# 1) seperates the ICD codes that mapped to GBD causes from those that map to garbage;
# 2) loops over all years and locations (most-detailed GBD location) of VR data with garbage codes;
# 3) merges in proportional redistribution files, and applies the redistribution proportions;
# 4) combines mapped and redistributed data;
# 5) reshapes the data from long to wide, to produce one row for every location, date, age, and sex, and one column for each cause of death;
# 6) expands out the dataset to ensure that there is one row for every location, date, age, and sex (i.e. it fills in any rows where no deaths occurred);
# 7) calculates all cause mortality, and drops and causes with fewer than 1 death (since these are not useful for our analysis)
#
# Requires: dplyr, data.table (should have already been loaded by the master script)
